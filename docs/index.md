While this site is meant as a repository for research papers, here are some good starting points:

- **[What is reinforcement learning?](what-is-rl.md)** A quick intro to what this is all about.
- **[Best RL educational resources](best-resources.md)** A number of excellent articles and courses to get started on this topic.
- **[Foundational papers](foundational-papers.md)** Most of the RL knowledge still only exists in papers - these provide a good starting point.
