> DeepMind Control: Recently, there have been a number
  of papers that have benchmarked for sample efficiency on
  challenging visual continuous control tasks belonging to the
  DMControl suite (Tassa et al., 2018) where the agent operates purely from pixels. The reason for operating in these
  environments is multi fold: (i) they present a reasonably
  challenging and diverse set of tasks; (ii) sample-efficiency
  of pure model-free RL algorithms operating from pixels
  on these benchmarks is poor; (iii) multiple recent efforts
  to improve the sample efficiency of both model-free and
  model-based methods on these benchmarks thereby giving
  us sufficient baselines to compare against; (iv) performance
  on the DM control suite is relevant to robot learning in real
  world benchmarks.
