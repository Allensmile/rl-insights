> A table of results and learning curves for all 49 games is provided in Appendix B. We consider
  the following two scoring metrics: (1) average reward per episode over entire training period (which
  favors fast learning), and (2) average reward per episode over last 100 episodes of training (which
  favors final performance). Table 2 shows the number of games “won” by each algorithm, where we
  compute the victor by averaging the scoring metric across three trials.
